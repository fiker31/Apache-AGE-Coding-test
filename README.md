# Apache-AGE-Coding-test
# Question 1 (Backend)
Developing Apache AGE requires a lot of logical thinking that backend development often requires.

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple calculator program written in C. It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and calculates Fibonacci numbers.

## Development Environment
The project was developed using the following environment:
- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: [Specify the operating system used during development, e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux]

## Prerequisites
To compile and run the source code, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- GCC compiler (or any C compiler compatible with your operating system)
- [Any additional dependencies or libraries, if applicable]

## Compilation and Execution
Follow these steps to compile and run the source code:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source code using the following command:
If you are using a different C compiler, adjust the command accordingly.

4. After successful compilation, an executable file named `Question_1` (or the specified output filename) will be generated in the project directory.

5. Run the program by executing the following command:
If you're on Windows, use the command `Question_1.exe` instead.

6. The program will display the output of various calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and Fibonacci numbers.

7. Follow the on-screen instructions, if any, to provide input values or interact with the program.

## Examples
Here are some example inputs and outputs you may encounter while running the program:
add: 16
mul: 20
sub: -4
fibo: 2
